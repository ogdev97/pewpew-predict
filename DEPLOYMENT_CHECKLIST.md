- [x] Security analysis documented
- [x] Hardhat configuration
- [x] Deployment scripts
- [x] Test suite setup

## üîß Before Testnet Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Create `.env.local`:
```env
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_id

# After deploying contract
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# For deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
```

### 3. Deploy Contract to BSC Testnet
```bash
# Compile
yarn compile

# Deploy
yarn deploy:testnet

# Copy the deployed address and add to .env.local
```

### 4. Create Markets (Admin Only)
Use BSCScan or write a script to create markets:
```solidity
createMarket("Will BNB reach $2000?", 1735689600)
createMarket("Will PolyMarket announce TGE?", 1738368000)
createMarket("Will Ethereum merge succeed?", 1740960000)
createMarket("Will DeFi TVL exceed $200B?", 1743552000)
```

### 5. Test the DApp
```bash
yarn dev
```

Test flow:
1. Connect wallet
2. Set bet amount
3. Swipe right (YES) or left (NO)
4. Confirm transaction
5. Check BSCScan for transaction
6. Verify event emission

## üöÄ Mainnet Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Test extensively on testnet
- [ ] Set up multi-sig wallet
- [ ] Prepare emergency procedures

### Deployment
1. [ ] Deploy contract to BSC Mainnet
2. [ ] Verify on BSCScan
3. [ ] Transfer ownership to multi-sig
4. [ ] Create initial markets
5. [ ] Update frontend config
6. [ ] Deploy frontend
7. [ ] Announce launch
